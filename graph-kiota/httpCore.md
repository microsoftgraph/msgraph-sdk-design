### IHttpCore

The primary purpose of the IHttpCore interface is to define the core methods to send requests by the client library generated by Kiota.Builder.  This interface will be implemented by us (Microsoft Graph SDK team) in the Kiota Core library for each language. The Kiota Core library will be the default set of implementations of the Kiota Abstractions for a specific language. Kiota Core is generic client used with the service library generated by Kiota.Builder. We will need to provide a Microsoft Graph specific implementation of the middleware and serializers to an instance of HttpCore from Kiota Core. The middleware and serializers will come from the Graph.Core library (maybe, from something like a factory or extension, TBD).

State the requirement with description and example of when to use each of the following IHTTPCore function.
```
sendAsync<ModelType extends Parsable>(requestInfo: RequestInformation, type: new() => ModelType, responseHandler: ResponseHandler | undefined): Promise<ModelType>;
```

```
sendCollectionAsync<ModelType extends Parsable>(requestInfo: RequestInformation, type: new() => ModelType, responseHandler: ResponseHandler | undefined): Promise<ModelType[]>;
```

```
sendPrimitiveAsync<ResponseType>(requestInfo: RequestInformation, responseType: "string" | "number" | "boolean" | "Date" | "ReadableStream", responseHandler: ResponseHandler | undefined): Promise<ResponseType>;
```

```        
sendNoResponseContentAsync(requestInfo: RequestInformation, responseHandler: ResponseHandler | undefined): Promise<void>;
```        

```        
enableBackingStore(backingStoreFactory?: BackingStoreFactory | undefined): void;
```



Kiota core implementation 

   
```
constructor(authProvider, parseNodeFactory, serializationWriteFactory, httpClient);
```
